      <h2>My Projects</h2>

      <article id="rockbound">
        <img draggable="false" src="images/rockbound.jpg" alt="Gameplay screenshot from Rockbound jam project" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Rockbound</h3>
        <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Built during a jam under strict time limits, Rockbound demonstrates my ability to design balanced mechanics under pressure. I focused on creating systems that encourage exploration and player mastery despite rapid prototyping constraints.</p>

        <h4>Metadata</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Event:</strong> Game Jam</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity, C#, Aseprite</li>
          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Game Designer</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 48 hours</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Constraints</h4>
        <p>Rockbound was created during a highly restrictive jam environment. The team had limited time and resources, so we had to prioritize mechanics that would deliver maximum impact with minimal scope creep.</p>

        <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed and balanced core mechanics under tight deadlines.</li>
          <li>Created level flow and narrative context to support player immersion.</li>
          <li>Collaborated with artists and programmers to ensure scope feasibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Process & Key Decisions</h4>
        <p>I quickly prototyped a loop that emphasized player skill over grind. Playtest feedback was incorporated within hours, not days, to refine mechanics. The focus was on clarity, simplicity, and fun.</p>

        <h4>Outcomes & Results</h4>
        <p>The game was successfully submitted on time, earning positive feedback for its mechanical polish and balance. The project reinforced my ability to work effectively under jam conditions.</p>

        <h4>Reflection & Growth</h4>
        <p><em>I learned how to cut scope aggressively without sacrificing player experience, a skill I continue to apply in larger projects.</em></p>

      <!-- Animal Whacker Case Study -->
      <article id="animal-whacker">
        <img draggable="false" src="images/animal-whacker.jpg" alt="Gameplay screenshot of Animal Whacker action platformer" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Animal Whacker</h3>
        <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> An action platformer inspired by Katana Zero and My Friend Pedro, designed for flow and high-impact combat. I created levels and enemy patterns that reward precision and creativity, delivering a satisfying fast-paced experience.</p>

        <h4>Metadata</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Event:</strong> Pirate Software Jam 2024</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Trello, Miro</li>
          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Game Designer</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 weeks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Constraints</h4>
        <p>The jam theme required interpreting “Sacrifice is Strength.” I explored this through risk-reward gameplay where player choices amplify their combat potential.</p>

        <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed enemy AI patterns and level pacing.</li>
          <li>Integrated alchemy-inspired mechanics.</li>
          <li>Collaborated on design documentation and feedback loops with the team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Process & Key Decisions</h4>
        <p>Drawing from Katana Zero, I emphasized flow — making death fast, retries instant, and movement satisfying. This meant tuning hitboxes, enemy placements, and aim assist to maximize player empowerment.</p>

        <h4>Outcomes & Results</h4>
        <p>The project delivered a playable, fast-paced prototype that successfully captured the intended feeling of being an unstoppable force.</p>

        <h4>Reflection & Growth</h4>
        <p><em>I developed sharper instincts for pacing and difficulty curves, especially in high-speed action environments.</em></p>

      <!-- Project: Wild Case Study -->
      <article id="project-wild">
        <img draggable="false" src="images/project-wild.jpg" alt="Prototype screenshot from Project: Wild survival game" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Project: Wild</h3>
        <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> A survival-themed prototype where I emphasized systemic interactions and player agency. My focus was on resource management and crafting loops that keep players engaged while shaping emergent narratives.</p>

        <h4>Metadata</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Type:</strong> Prototype</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Godot, GDScript, Trello</li>
          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Systems Designer</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 week</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Constraints</h4>
        <p>The project was built with a small team, balancing scope with ambition. The focus was on creating compelling mechanics first, before expanding into worldbuilding.</p>

        <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed resource management and crafting systems.</li>
          <li>Documented mechanics clearly for team alignment.</li>
          <li>Prototyped and iterated on survival loops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Process & Key Decisions</h4>
        <p>We prioritized emergent interactions (e.g., crafting + environment hazards) to allow players to discover strategies organically. I worked closely with teammates to balance realism with fun.</p>

        <h4>Outcomes & Results</h4>
        <p>The prototype successfully demonstrated the viability of survival loops that encourage exploration and replayability. The system design is strong enough to expand into a full project.</p>

        <h4>Reflection & Growth</h4>
        <p><em>I gained experience in systems thinking, balancing player freedom with structured mechanics.</em></p>
